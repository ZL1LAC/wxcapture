## What is Weather Satellite receiving?
There are thousands of satellites currently in orbit, with many satellites passing in the sky overhead at any given moment.
You can receive some of them yourself with a cheap SDR and antenna, and with weather satellites, you can receive beautiful images of the Earth as seen from space taken by satellites in orbit, decoded in near real-time.

## Installation
This is currently a manual process, with the instructions for installing the pi and server code currently being documented in the following spreadsheet:
https://github.com/wxcapture/wxcapture/blob/master/WxCapture.xlsx

  An installer will be created some time later after WxCapture is "officially" released.

## Dynamic and Static pages:
- ```index.html``` and ```satellites.html``` are static
