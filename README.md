# About
There are thousands of satellites currently in orbit, with many satellites passing in the sky overhead at any given moment.
You can receive some of them yourself with a cheap SDR and antenna, and with weather satellites, you can receive beautiful images of the Earth as seen from space taken by satellites in orbit, decoded in near real time.
